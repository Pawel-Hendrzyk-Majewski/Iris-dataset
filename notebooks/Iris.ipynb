    "The Iris dataset is the most famus and erliest dataset used in the literature on classification methods and machine learning. It was used in R.A. Fisher's landmark 1936 paper _\"The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems\"_. In his article, Fisher demonstrate how to use multiple features simultaneously to best classify objects belonging to different groups. This statistical method has been named **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**."
